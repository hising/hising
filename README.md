Product & UX expert with 25+ years in top tech companies (EA, DICE, King). Passionate about user-focused design and automation. Worked on AAA titles like Battlefield and Star Wars: Battlefront. Strategic laziness advocate—automate everything!

Tries to focus on being pragmatic, helping peers, and building great teams.

I love building stuff – if it ain't broke, I probably haven’t had a go at it yet! I use whatever tools are needed, even if that means duct tape and a little bit of hope.
