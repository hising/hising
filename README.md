Owner of [Yetric AB](https://yetric.se)

25+ years of work experience. Former EA, DICE, Embark Studios, King, Star Stable, bwin, Ongame, 3, Framtidsfabriken etc. 

Tries to focus on being pragmatic, helping peers, and building great teams.

I love building stuff – if it ain't broke, I probably haven’t had a go at it yet! I use whatever tools are needed, even if that means duct tape and a little bit of hope.

Worked on multiple [AAA-games](https://www.mobygames.com/person/593361/mattias-hising/) - Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline, Star Wars: Battlefront, Battlefield 1 and multiple DLC:s.
